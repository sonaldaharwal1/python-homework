# Figure out the values required for range() to generate the expected result:

# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(???)

# 20, 21, 22 ... 30 (all the numbers between 20 and 30, inclusive)
range(???)

# Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
range(???)

# Years ending in zero between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive)
range(???)

# Bonus!
# 20, 19, 18, 17, 16
range(???)
